this Privacy Policy and agreed to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal
information is stored and processed securely and in accordance with this
Privacy Policy and applicable laws.
</p>

<p><u><b>THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b></u></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to personal information, which is information
that can be used to contact or identify a single person.
</p>

<p>We collect information that you give us. We receive and store safely any

</p>

<p>We collect automatic information. We receive and store certain types of
information whenever you interact with us.
</p>

<p>We collect information used in e-mail communications. To help us make
e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation
when you open e-mail from our e-shopping website if your device supports
such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received
from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages
to our customers.
</p>

<p>We collect information from other sources. We might receive information
about you from other sources, which are duly authorized by yourself to
transfer such information to third parties and add it to our account information.
</p>

<p><u><b>HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></u></p>
<ul>
	<li/><p>The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted
	on our latest product announcements, software updates, and upcoming events.
	If you don't want to be on our mailing list, you can opt out anytime by
	updating your preferences.</p>

	<li/><p>We also use personal information to help us create, develop,
	operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content, and advertising
	to improve your user experience continually.</p>

	<li/><p>We may use your personal information to respond to your inquiries and fulfill
	your requests.</p>

	<li/><p>We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify
	identity, assist with identification of users, and to determine
	appropriate services. For example, we may use date of birth to
	determine the age of user account holders.</p>
	
	<li/><p>From time to time, we may use your personal information to
	send important notices, such as communications about purchases and
	changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information
	is important to your interaction with us, you may not opt out of
	receiving these communications.</p>

	<li/><p>We may also use personal information for internal purposes
	such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve our products,
	services, and customer communications.</p>
</ul>

<p><u><b>COLLECTION AND USE OF NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></u></p>
<p>We may also collect information which does not, on its own,
allow direct association with any specific individual. We may collect,
use, transfer and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.
Here are some examples of non-personal data that we may collect:</p>
<ul>
	<li/><p>Non-personal data such as language, unique device identifier, referrer
	URL, location, and the time zone where one of our products is used
	so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our
	products, services, and advertising.</p>
	
	<li/><p>Non-personal data regarding customer activities on our website, cloud
	services or the app store and from our other products and services.

	useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of

	purposes of this privacy policy, this type of data is considered to
	be non-personal information.</p>

	used to improve the relevancy of results provided by our services.

	address.</p>

	<li/><p>With your consent, we may collect data about how you use your device and
	applications in order to help application developers to improve their applications.</p>
</ul>

<p>If we do combine non-personal information with personal information, the
combined information will be treated as personal information for as
long as it remains combined.</p>

<p><u><b>COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES</b></u></p>
<p>Ourwebsites, online services, interactive applications, email messages,
and advertisements may use &quot;cookies&quot; and other
technologies. These technologies help us better understand user
behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited,
and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and
web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other
technologies as non-personal information. However, to the extent that
IP addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal
information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal
information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information
is combined with personal information, we treat the combined
information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy
Policy.</p>

<p>Kai and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to
remember personal information when you use our website, online
services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is to make
your experience with Kai more convenient and personal. For example,
knowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a
certain product or used a particular service helps us make our
advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests.</p>

<p>You may configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or
notify you when a cookie is sent. Each browser is different, so check
the &quot;Help&quot; menu of your browser to learn how to change your
cookie preferences. For example, on Microsoft Internet Explorer you
can disable or delete cookies by selecting &quot;Tools/Internet
Options&quot;.</p>

<p>In some of our email messages, we use a &quot;click-through URL&quot; linked to
content on our website. When customers click one of these URLs, they
pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination
page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us
determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness
of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in
this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email
messages.</p>

<p><u><b>DO WE SHARE THE INFORMATION?</b></u></p>
<p>We do not share personal information with companies, organizations
and individuals outside of Kai unless one of the following circumstances
applies. Kai may share personal information with your consent.</p>

<p>We may disclose personal information to our affiliates when necessary
to perform services on our or on your behalf.</p>

<p>We cooperate with companies and individuals to perform functions on our
behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages,
sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from
customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance,
providing search results and links (including paid listings and
links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer
service. They have access to personal information needed to perform
their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.</p>

<p>We will share personal information with organizations or individuals outside
our organization if we believe that access, use, preservation or
disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:</p>
<ul>
	<li/><p>meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable
	governmental request.</p>

	<li/><p>detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.</p>
	
	<li/><p>protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of our users or the
	public, as required or permitted by law.</p>
</ul>
<p><u><b>SECURITY AND TRANSPARENCY</b></u></p>
<p>We will endeavor to take all reasonable physical, technical and
organizational measures and procedures to safeguard and secure the
personal information we collect through our products,
services and our website.</p>

hard to protect our company reputation and our users from
unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or
destruction of personal information that we hold. In particular:</p>
<ul>
	<li/><p>We review our information collection, storage and processing practices,
	including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized
	access to systems;</p>

	<li/><p>We use encryption where appropriate;</p>

	<li/><p>We use password protection where appropriate;</p>

	<li/><p>We restrict access to personal information to our employees,
	contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to
	process it for us and who are subject to strict contractual
	confidentiality obligations. They may be disciplined or their
	contract may be terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>
</ul>
<p>However, these measures do not release you from taking appropriate steps to
keep your personal information safe and secure, in particular by
avoiding obvious user ID's or passwords, by ensuring that you do not
disclose your password(s) or grant any other person access to your
user account and your personal information, and any other protective
measures applicable.</p>

transparency, our goal is to be clear what information we collect, so
that you can make choices about how it is used.</p>
